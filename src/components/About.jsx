                    <p className='description'>   
                    In 2017, I started my professional career performing internal, IT audits where I used my coding knowledge
                    to enhance control testing through code inspection. Moving on further into external audit, I began to miss the excitement 
                    and thrills of creating things through coding. In 2021, I restarted my journey of becoming a developer.

                    While I do have a formal education in Computer Science, all of my web development knowledge and skills are 
                    self-taught, driven entirely by my desire to make things.

                    Outside of dev, I enjoy volunteering in the community through various ways including helping at the local animal
                    shelter and being a volunteer Firefighter. I also love playing games with my friends, going to the gym, and spending
                    time with my fianc√©e and animals (1 dog and 3 cats)!
